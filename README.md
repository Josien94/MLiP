This repository contains code and supplementary material for participated Kaggle Challenges.

## Challenge 1: I'm Something of a Painter Myself 
The first challenge can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started.
This challenge includes style transfer from Monet style to the 'COCO2017' dataset (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/coco).
As a result, we created 7000 images in the style of Monet.

We are inspired by the model introduced by Johnson et al. [1]. This model introduces neural style transfer with the use of a pre-trained VGG-16 network. 

The code and results of this challenge can be found in the corresponding folder: _Challenge1 - I'm Something of a Painter myself_.
This folder exists of the following files:
- johnson-v2.ipynb; A python notebook containing the source code
- johnson-v2.zip; A zipped version of the notebook (as it is quite large)
- model.zip; The final model created for neural style transfer
- graphs.zip; Graphs with various model outcomes (loss, norm of weights, mean gradient and variance of gradient)
- johnson_v2_best.ipynb; The notebook which gave the highest score in the challenge (but we don't use this as our final submission).
- johnson-v2_best.zip; A zipped version of the notebook (as it is quite large)
